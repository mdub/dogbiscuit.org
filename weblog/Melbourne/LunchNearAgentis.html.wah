Last week was my last at {Agentis Software}@http://www.agentissoftware.com.
Among the things that I'll miss are the lunches ...  some workplaces have a
habit of getting thoroughly wasted together on a periodic basis; at
Agentis, we developed a culture centered around food, usually of the Asian
persuasion.  These are/were some of our regular lunch haunts ...

- The *Westlake*, 189 Little Bourke St, for yum-cha.  Good service, great
  food.  Try the fried calamari.

- "Dodgy Dumpling" (real name: *Camy Shanghai*) in Tattersalls Lane.
  Steaming mounds of fried dumplings with loads of chilli sauce ... mmmm.

- *Spicy Noodle Cafe*, on LaTrobe, opposite Melbourne Central.  Very
  generous servings of noodles, rice, soup, etc.  Busy but friendly.

I hope to meet up with the old crowd for the occasional lunch ... but not
'cos I like them or anything :-)
