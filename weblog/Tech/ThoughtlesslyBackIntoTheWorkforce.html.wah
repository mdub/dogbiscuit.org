As of last week, I'm developing software for money again, after a {nine month break}@/Family/NineMonthsAtHome.

At the same time, I'm saying goodbye to {ThoughtWorks}@http://www.thoughtworks.com, which is not easy, since I've really enjoyed my time there.  I joined TW to hang out with good people, and wasn't disappointed: the faces have changed a little over the years (as people come and go), but TW still employs some of the most talented and passionate people I've ever had the opportunity to work with.

In the end, though, I figured it was time to try something new.  I'm now working for {Cogent Consulting}@http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au.  I've known Steve and Marty, who run the company, since the early days of the {Melbourne eXtreme Programming group}@http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/melbourne_XP_enthusiasts/, and have a lot of respect for them both.  They've started to assemble a very interesting, talented bunch of individuals, and I'm looking forward to the ride.  

Among other things, I'm going to be doing a whole lot more {Ruby}@http://ruby-lang.org and {Rails}@http://rubyonrails.org work than I have to-date.  Which feels good, since I've been {blathering about Ruby}@/Tech/Programming/Ruby/Ruby@EJA
 for a {few years now}@/Tech/Projects/Eyaw/gettingStarted.
