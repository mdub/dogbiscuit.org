Thanks to Ovidiu Predescu for his blog entry on "{Setting up ssh-agent on
Windows
XP}@http://www.webweavertech.com/ovidiu/weblog/archives/000326.html".

+ssh-agent+ allows you to protect your SSH private-keys with a pass-phrase,
while avoiding having to continuously re-enter the pass-phrase.

It's very easy to set up under Linux; in fact, in most distros it's
probably running by default.  As Ovidiu points out, it's actually fairly
easy to set up in Windows XP, too, using {Cygwin}@http://cygwin.com/
OpenSSH.  The trick is to pre-select the agent bind address ...

First, create a new Windows environment variable called "+SSH_AUTH_SOCK+",
and give it the value "<code>\/tmp\/.ssh-socket</code>".

Next, insert the following snippet in your <code>~/.bashrc</code>:

| ssh-add -l >/dev/null 2>&1
| if [ $? = 2 ]; then
|     # exit-status 2 = couldn't connect to ssh-agent
|     echo -n "Starting SSH agent ... "
|     eval `ssh-agent -a $SSH_AUTH_SOCK`
| fi

This will start a new +ssh-agent+ if there isn't yet one running (this is a
slight simplification of Ovidiu's script).

Now, type just "+ssh-add+", and your pass-phrase, and SSH in peace.
