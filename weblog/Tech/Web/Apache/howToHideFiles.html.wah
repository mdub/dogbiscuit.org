I use CVS to manage my web-content, so that I can edit it and upload
changes.  An unfortunate side-effect is that my web content-directory is
littered with "+CVS+" directories.  I'd rather people weren't able to view
them.

Luckily, my hoster supports +mod_rewrite+, so it was just a matter of
adding the following line to .htaccess:

|     RewriteRule     CVS(/.*)?$      -       [F]
