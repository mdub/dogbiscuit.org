A couple of months ago I gave a presentation on
{Ruby}@http://www.ruby-lang.org and {Rails}@http://rubyonrails.org to a
{local Java user-group}@http://www.enterprisejava.org.au/.  My slides are
now online:

* {Ruby@EJA}@/../presentations/Ruby@EJA/

It contains a few examples showing how expressive Ruby can be, when
compared to Java.
