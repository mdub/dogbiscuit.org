title: A Python-esque alternative to Ant
published: 22 July 2003

{Pynt}@http://pynt.sf.net is "a scripting language designed to simplify
running builds".  Nice.  It's similar in intent to Ant, but has a
Python-like syntax allowing true scripting.

IMHO the most promising feature is the ability to encapsulate re-usable
build-logic in methods.  In Ant, you'd need to create a custom task
(ie. drop into Java), or invoke Ant recursively (*very* ugly and
frustrating).
